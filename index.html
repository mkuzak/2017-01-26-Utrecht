  ETHERPAD

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<!--
  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "{{site.swc_github}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).

<h3>OpenRefine</h3>
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download OpenRefine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>
<li>Click on <i>Windows kit</i> to download the install file
<li>To use it, unzip, and double-click on openrefine.exe (if you're having issues
with openrefine.exe try refine.bat instead)
<li>OpenRefine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
</ul>

<h3>SQLite</h3>
<br>
For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
the web browser Firefox.
<ul>
<li>If you don't already have Firefox installed
<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>install Firefox</a>
<li>Start Firefox
<li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
<li> Click the "Add Now" button.
<li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
<li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
<li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
</ul>
</ol>

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
